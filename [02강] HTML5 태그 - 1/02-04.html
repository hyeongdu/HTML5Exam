	<h2> Where does it come from?</h2>
	<p>
		Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br/>
		It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br/>
		making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
		at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure<br/>
		Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through <br/>
		the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.<br/>

	<h2> What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
	<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br/>
	   Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br/>
	   when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a <br/>
	   specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br/>
       electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br/>
